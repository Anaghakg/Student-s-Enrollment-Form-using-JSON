# Student-s-Enrollment-Form-using-JSON
**TOPIC:** Student Enrollment Form

DESCRIPTION:
This project creates a web form for enrolling students, where each student has a unique Roll No. The form allows you to add new students or update existing ones. When you start, the Roll No field is ready, and the buttons are disabled. If the Roll No is new, you can fill in the details and click [Save] to add the student. If the Roll No exists, you can edit the information and click [Update] to save changes. [Reset] clears the form. All data is stored in a JSONPowerDB database.
